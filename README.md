# Project Euler Repository

Project Euler is an external website with relevant series of mathematical and computational problems. As the website states:

"The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere."

I will solve eventually all 100 initial problems on my free time. Mainly in Python, C/C++ (even some can be solved by hand!).
